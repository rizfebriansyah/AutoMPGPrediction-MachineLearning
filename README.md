# AutoMPGPrediction-MachineLearning
 
The 398 car records in the Auto MPG sample data set span the years 1970 to 1982. It includes information about the car's name, MPG, cylinder tally, horsepower, and weight. Here, using deep learning models, IÂ will attempt to predict the miles per galon (MPG) of a car. I have downloaded the dataset AUTO MPG rom the UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)
